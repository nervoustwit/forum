        <h2>Hi-Tech Mushroom Burger</h2>
        <p class="meta">by Grant Crilly</p>
        <ul>
            <li>5 g Kosher salt, (1 1/2 teaspoons)</li>
            <li>Black pepper, freshly ground, as needed </li>
            <li>60 g Unsalted butter, or neutral oil, divided </li>
            <li> cheese, slices, optional, as needed </li>
        </ul>
        <p> To cook burgers indoors: Season 3 mushroom patties with salt and pepper on both sides. In a 12-inch skillet, melt 30 g (2 tablespoons) butter over medium-high heat until foaming. Add seasoned mushroom patties and cook until well browned on bottom side, about 3 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until well browned on second side, about 2 minutes longer. Top patties with cheese (if using), cover, and cook until cheese is melted, about 1 minute longer.</p>
        <p> Transfer burgers to a sheet pan. Wipe out skillet and repeat cooking process with remaining patties.</p>
        <p> To grill burgers: Light a large chimney starter filled 3/4 of the way up with charcoal. When coals are lit and mostly covered with gray ash, spread evenly over half of coal grate to create a two-zone grilling setup. Set grill grate in place, cover grill, and open lid vents completely. Heat for 5 minutes. Once grill is hot, remove lid, clean and oil grill grate.</p>
        <p> Place mushroom patties on grill grate directly over coals on hot side of the grill. Cook, undisturbed, until a lightly charred crust forms on bottom side, about 2 minutes. Flip, top with cheese (if using), and transfer to cool side of grill. Close grill lid and continue to cook until cheese is melted and mushroom burgers are heated through, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Transfer burgers to a sheet pan.</p>
