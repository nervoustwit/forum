        PARAMETER DOCUMENTATION

        `remote-url` - This should be the base url of the site you are embedding. REQUIRED
        `initial-path` - The initial path the embed should start on if there isn't one in the URL already.
        `position` - This has two possible values
            - `sticky` - The community content will stick to the top of the page when scrolling, pushing the header out of the viewport. DEFAULT
            - `static` - Users will have to scroll outside of the community to scroll the header off of the page.
        `sso-string` - Pass a community members unique string to provide them access through SSO or define it on as `vanilla_sso` in the window object of the page

        NOTES
        - The `height: 100vh` is recommended for the best user experience.
